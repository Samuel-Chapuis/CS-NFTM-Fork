Represent the weight of each time step as vectors ( parameters for the tensors while doing matrix operation, grad=true in optimizer.step ) and add this in the trianing.
Make sure to limite the contexte windows
SSIM or PSNR loss 
Take look at optuna
try r^2
calculate partial autocorelation for the number for the number of time steps (can be a variable for optuna)
