Represent the weight of each time step as vectors ( parameters for the tensors while doing matrix operation, grad=true in optimizer.step ) and add this in the trianing.
Make sure to limite the contexte windows
SSIM or PSNR loss 
Take look at optuna
try r^2
calculate partial autocorelation for the number for the number of time steps (can be a variable for optuna)
see TCN (time series CN) 
see Immutation as an input (new feature)

Draw float chart of each model ( tensor board to do so)
Add a key querry value metrix for the attention 

cursor

Sperate train and test !
Average the metric over all the images
Show the weight the time steps


try to test the model with a new viscosity value
