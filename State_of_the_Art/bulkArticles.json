However, most of these techniques merely localize a group of key-points by regressing their coordinates, which are vulnerable to occlusion and have poor performance for multi-object pose estimation. These methods cannot directly regress the 6D pose estimation from a loss during training. In this paper, we propose a framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and self-attention mechanism as an end-to-end method for single and multi-object 6D pose estimation using RGB images with low computational cost. Our method utilizes feature fusion to extract local features and combines multi-head self-attention (MHSA) with iterative refinement to improve pose estimation performance.

The roots of AI in language processing can be traced back to Alan Turing\u2019s 1950 work, which established foundational principles for natural language processing (NLP). Early iterations of NLP primarily concentrated on natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG), but they faced significant challenges related to contextual comprehension and the handling of lengthy text sequences. Recent advancements in NLP have demonstrated considerable promise in automating the analysis of unstructured data, including electronic health records and radiology reports. LLMs, which are based on the transformer architecture introduced in 2017, excel at capturing complex language dependencies and facilitating tasks, such as report generation and clinical decision support. This review critically examines the evolution from traditional NLP to LLMs, highlighting their transformative potential within the field of radiology. Despite the advantages presented by LLMs, challenges persist, including concerns regarding data privacy, the potential for generating misinformation, and the imperative for rigorous validation protocols.

Under this assignment, symbolic computation becomes represented by trajectories of state vectors in a real phase space, that allows for statistical correlation analyses with real-world measurements and experimental data. However, these assignments are usually completely arbitrary. Hence, it makes sense to address the problem which aspects of the dynamics observed under a G\u00f6del representation is intrinsic to the dynamics and which are not. In this study, we develop a formally rigorous mathematical framework for the investigation of symmetries and invariants of neural automata under different encodings.

We consider different macroscopic observables, such as the mean activation level of the neural network, and ask for their invariance properties. Our main result shows that only step functions that are defined over those patterns of equality are invariant under symbolic recodings, while the mean activation, e.g., is not.

To fully leverage its advantages, converting the external analog signals to spikes is an essential prerequisite. Conventional approaches including analog-to-digital converters or ring oscillators, and sensors suffer from high power and area costs. Recent efforts are devoted to constructing artificial sensory neurons based on emerging devices inspired by the biological sensory system. They can simultaneously perform sensing and spike conversion, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional sensory systems. This review summarizes and benchmarks the recent progress of artificial sensory neurons. It starts with the presentation of various mechanisms of biological signal transduction, followed by the systematic introduction of the emerging devices employed for artificial sensory neurons. Furthermore, the implementations with different perceptual capabilities are briefly outlined and the key metrics and potential applications are also provided.

The objective of this project was to develop a clinically applicable and robust artificial intelligence (AI) system to assist radiation oncologists in OAR segmentation. The CNN was trained using manual contours in CT-datasets from diagnostic ^68Ga-PSMA-PET/CTs by a student, then validated (n\u2009=\u200930, PET/CTs) and tested (n\u2009=\u200916, planning CTs). Further segmentations were generated by a commercial artificial intelligence (cAI) software. The ground truth were manual contours from expert radiation oncologists. The performance was evaluated using the Dice-S\u00f8rensen Coefficient (DSC), visual analysis and a Turing test. The CNN yielded excellent results in both cohorts and OARs with a DSC_median\u2009>\u20090.87, the cAI resulted in a DSC\u2009>\u20090.78. In the visual assessment, 67% (bladder) and 75% (rectum) of the segmentations were rated as acceptable for treatment planning. With a misclassification rate of 45.5% (bladder) and 51.1% (rectum), the CNN passed the Turing test.

Traditional knowledge question answering is to provide precise answer entities and neglect the defects; namely, users hope to receive a complete natural answer. In this research, we propose a novel attention-based recurrent neural network for natural answer generation, which is enhanced with multi-level copying mechanisms and question-aware loss. To generate natural answers that conform to grammar, we leverage multi-level copying mechanisms and the prediction mechanism which can copy semantic units and predict common words. Moreover, considering the problem that the generated natural answer does not match the user question, question-aware loss is introduced to make the generated target answer sequences correspond to the question. Experiments on three response generation tasks show our model to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 0.727 BLEU on the SimpleQuestions response generation task, improving over the existing best results by over 0.007 BLEU. Our model has scored a significant enhancement on naturalness with up to 0.05 more than best performing baseline.

Most ATF interpolation methods aim to model the ATF for fixed source by using techniques that fit the estimation to the measurements while not taking the physics of the problem into consideration. We aim to interpolate the ATF for a region-to-region estimation, meaning we account for variation of both source and receiver positions. By using a very general formulation for the reproducing kernel function, we have created a kernel function that considers both directed and residual fields as two separate kernel functions. The directed field kernel considers a sparse selection of reflective field components with large amplitudes and is formulated as a combination of directional kernels. The residual field is composed of the remaining densely distributed components with lower amplitudes. Its kernel weight is represented by a universal approximator, a neural network, in order to learn patterns from the data freely. These kernel parameters are learned using Bayesian inference both under the assumption of Gaussian priors and by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method to perform inference in a more directed manner. We compare all established kernel formulations with each other in numerical simulations, showing that the proposed kernel model is capable of properly representing the complexities of the ATF."}, "subjects": ["Engineering", "Signal,Image and Speech Processing", "Mathematics in Music", "Acoustics", "Engineering Acoustics"], "disciplines": [{"id": "2885", "term": "Signal, Speech and Image Processing"}, {"id": "6426", "term": "Mathematics in Music"}, {"id": "5882", "term": "Acoustics"}, {"id": "6239", "term": "Engineering Acoustics"}], "key_issn": "1687-4722"}, {"contentType": "Article", "identifier": "doi:10.1007/s12559-023-10181-0", "language": "en", "url": [{"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-023-10181-0"}], "title": "Convolutionary, Evolutionary, and Revolutionary: What\u2019s Next for Brains, Bodies, and AI?", "creators": [{"ORCID": "0000-0002-3312-7505", "creator": "Stratton, Peter"}], "publicationName": "Cognitive Computation", "doi": "10.1007/s12559-023-10181-0", "publisher": "Springer", "publisherName": "Springer US", "publicationDate": "2024-09-01", "publicationType": "Journal", "issn": "1866-9956", "eIssn": "1866-9964", "volume": "16", "number": "5", "issueType": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "startingPage": "2420", "endingPage": "2427", "journalId": "12559", "openAccess": "true", "printDate": "2024-08-03", "onlineDate": "2023-08-12", "coverDate": "2024-09", "copyright": "\u00a92023 The Author(s)", "abstract": {"h1": "Abstract", "p": "The flexibility, adaptability, and resilience of even simple brains are unmatched by any current technology.
